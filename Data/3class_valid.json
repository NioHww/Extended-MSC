He witnesses a high profile murder and the cops are searching for him, Thinking it was like an old bag lady, But confused as to why the possible witness had a presidents book wrapped in plastic out there.

I would try it with the soy cheese since I eat vegan but that sounds yummy. I'm always looking for new ideas.
